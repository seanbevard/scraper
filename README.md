# MLS Scraper
MLS Scraper is a Node/Express/Handlebars/MongoDB app that allows you to scrape news articles off of MLSSoccer.com, and add your own notes to each article.  Notes and article links are stored in a Mongo NoSQL database.  You also have the option to delete a single article, or delete all articles at once.  Similarly, you can delete individual notes as well.

## Installation

```
PORT=3001
```

## Usage
todo: Add route to delete a note.

- To run locally use the command `npm run dev` to start up nodemon with dotenv config variables mentioned above.
- Use browser to navigate to the correct `http://localhost:port` address.
